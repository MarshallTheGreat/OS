###Linux Auditing and Authentication

Authentication:
  - /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events
  - /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in
  - /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp
  - /var/log/btmp - Failed login attempts
  
Application:
  - apache; web server
  - apt; package manager
  - /var/log/mysql.log
  
System:
  - /var/log/messages
  - /var/log/syslog
  - dmesg = Device Messenger (Queries /proc/kmsg)
  
Logging Daemon:
  - /usr/sbin/rsyslogd
    - User space daemon; reads messages written to /dev/log and formats and stores them based on /etc/rsyslog.conf rules
      - syslog() via libc
      - kernel ring buffer
      - audit records via audit subsystem (auditd)
      
Config File:
  - /etc/rsyslog.conf
    - Log entries follow syslog standard (facility.severity)
      - facility = what program, or part of system, log is from
      - severity = urgency
      
Facility Codes:
0   kernel messages
1   user-level messages
2   mail system
3   system daemons
4   security/authorization messages
5   messages generated internally by syslogd
6   line printer subsystem
7   network news subsystem
8   UUCP subsystem
9   clock daemon
10  security/authorization messages
11  FTP daemon
12  NTP subsystem13|log audit

Severity Codes:
0  emerg, panic:  Emergency: system is unusable
1  alert:         Action must be taken immediately
2  crit:          Critical conditions
3  err, error:    Error conditions
4  warn, warning: Warning conditions
5  notice:        Normal but significant condition
6  info:          Informational messages
7  Debug:         Debug-level messages
